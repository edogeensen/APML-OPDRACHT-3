    " -   Formalizing a practical problem into a Markov Decision Process (MDP).\n",
    " -   Gaining familiarity with the OpenAI Gym framework (recently renamed as Gymnasium) and utilizing it to implement RL agents.\n",
    " -   Applying SARSA and Q-learning algorithms to solve the 'robot in a maze' MDP problem.\n",
    " -   Evaluating the outcomes of the reinforcement learning process and interpreting your findings.\n",
    " -   Reflecting on the distinctions between the two types of RL algorithms employed.\n",

    "By accomplishing these objectives, you will not only enhance your understanding of RL algorithms but also develop practical skills in formulating and solving complex problems in the context of autonomous navigation within a maze.\n",

    "     2.2. implementing your own RL agents, and      \n",

    " - `animate_run` will enable you to see the agent's behavior. It takes a list of images which can be produced by the `env.render` function of the environment\n",
    " - `visualize_agent_brain` will provide you with a way to visualize the agents learned q_table. Use it after you have implemented and trained your agents. The first plot will show the highest q-value per state (position on the map) and the second will tell you which action the agent would choose at that state/position. It takes the environment and the agent as input.\n",

    "Below you will find a basic example of how the animation function works. Please notice that: whenever you **reset()** the environment, the agent will start at a random position (a different state). "
